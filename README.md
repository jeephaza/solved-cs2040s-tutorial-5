The main goal this week is to review for the midterm. We have posted the CS2040S 2020 midterm and CS2020 2017 quizzes (note that there is an additional Quiz 2 at the end of the CS2020 2017 quiz document), and the plan this week is to go over several of the problems from these papers. We would particularly recommend going over the following questions:

Sorting Jumble (any of the papers).

Algorithm Analysis (any of the papers).

Which is best? [Exclude skip lists] (CS2040S 2020, Q4A â€“ Q4D).

Hash it! (CS2020 2017 Quiz 2, Q2A).

Super Virus Fighter (CS2040S 2020, Q6).

Exploring Planet Nine, Part 2 (CS2020 2017 Quiz 1, Q4).

If time permits, you may also want to review questions from the following sets of MCQs:

How do they work? (CS2040S 2020, Q3).

Invariants (CS2040S 2020, Q5).
